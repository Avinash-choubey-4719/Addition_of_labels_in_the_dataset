# Addition_of_labels_in_the_dataset

A data scientist has to spend a lot of time preparing a dataset for any data science task because the data we get has a lot of errors, 
and sometimes it is not labeled. Adding labels to a dataset is very important before you can use it to solve a problem. One of those problems 
where adding labels to a dataset is very important is sentiment analysis, where you get the data as reviews or comments from users, and 
you need to add labels to it to prepare it for sentiment analysis.
